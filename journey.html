						Clinicians in the Classroom   
						<p><span class="tophead">A Journey Through Four Decades in Education</span></p>
						<p><span class="byline">By Barbara Slocum, MEd, CCC-SLP</span></p>
						<p>Last summer I hired a contractor to repair some ceiling damage in my home. After working for a few hours, he said, "I used to come to you to work on my speech. We used to work in a little closet." I laughed, remembering the tiny room on the second floor of the old school building. That was one of the work stations I used for the 10 years I was the sole provider of speech services in the district.</p>
						<p>As a young and relatively inexperienced therapist, I had the daunting task of developing a speech program for the entire district, which had a student population of 2,600 in grades K-12. But I jumped right in because I was eager to succeed.</p>
						<p>One was not encouraged to go into public education as a career in those days. We were told that working conditions were tough and we wouldn't make much money. But it was the '60s, and social awareness and the desire to make things better prevailed. The children who need the most help are in the schools, I thought, so that's where you go if you want to help.</p>
						<p>My ideals quickly collided with reality. There were lots of students and little time. It was the battle of numbers that continues even today. Thirty minutes was allotted for specials (art, etc.), and I needed to fit into that structure.</p>
						<p>Given a half-hour lesson, I thought instruction was diluted if the number of students in a group rose beyond three. Classroom teachers had class sizes of 25 to 28 students, and reading groups ranged from five to seven per group. Principals were usually former classroom teachers, so the size of the reading group model made sense to them as an appropriate model for speech therapy as well. The pressure to schedule large groups for speech was ever-present.</p>
						<p>When I would get together with other speech therapists to commiserate, the topic of numbers and scheduling always arose. "How many kids are you seeing?" was the usual question. And that's what it amounted to. We saw the students, and they saw us. How much behavior change you could facilitate was another story.</p>
						<p>Sometime within the first three years of my school career I decided to challenge the idea of large groups for speech with some data. I visited a neighboring school to observe the speech therapist, who apparently had large classes. I took a stopwatch with me and watched several lessons. The lesson for fourth- and fifth-graders with articulation problems exemplified how most sessions were conducted. They used workbooks, and the therapist addressed each student in turn, instructing and correcting them. When the students weren't talking, they were working in their workbook or coloring.</p>
						<p>I charted the amount of time each student spoke and was actively corrected. It was a hectic, pressured 30 minutes. When the students left, the speech-language pathologist and I complained about how impossible it was to meet student needs in a large-group format. I left feeling more determined than ever to "stick to my guns."</p>
						<p>In handling the data, I counted only the instructional time the therapist gave directly to the students and what they said back to her. Within the lesson each child received individual instruction and/or had talking time for four minutes. I did not assume students were learning from their workbooks because sometimes they did not learn and coaching had to be repeated. I concluded that we can shape and realistically evaluate speech and language when it is actually happening.</p>
						<p>When I reported my findings to district officials, they were surprised and sympathetic. I also had an ally–my building principal was a former speech therapist. With his support I was able to establish smaller speech groups. This became the accepted practice. (We have since learned that groupings of five to seven students are not effective for reading instruction either.)</p>
						<p>When I returned to work after a one-year leave of absence for the birth of my second child, the district retained my substitute. For the next 15 years there were two speech therapists. When we added pre-K, we hired another therapist to provide services to those students and for children who were referred by the county.</p>
						<p>My schedule has always been filled from morning until dismissal. Thirty years ago I had hall duty in the morning; now I'm engaged in team meetings or individualized push-in help until the formal instructional day begins at 9 a.m.</p>
						<p>When I worked with the 30-minute session model, I had a 30-minute prep period and a 30-minute lunch period. There were nine groups a day, with a 15-minute slot to slip in a needy student at the end of the day. That's nine times to call students to speech, nine lesson set-ups, nine differentiated instruction groups, and nine closures each day.</p>
						<p>My groups had two or three students. During the course of the day, I worked with 23 to 27 students, or one class of students. Two hours a week were set aside for testing. Now I have greater flexibility in scheduling and use a priority list and bloc scheduling dynamic speech program to manage speech and language needs. My push-in program has expanded, and I am providing accommodations for the state tests for classified students.</p>
						<p>Collaboration and flexibility in scheduling create a dynamic speech program that is more responsive to fluctuating student needs. I regularly meet with other professionals for training or to plan student intervention strategies. I no longer work in isolation.</p>
						<p>I was so happy to read about the workload model advocated by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).1 It is a realistic and reasonable way to weight students who have greater needs. Placement of those students on the schedule will reflect the philosophy of the therapist and the district.</p>
						<p>I have used the inclusion model throughout my career by placing students with high needs in groups with typical peers. It presents challenges in terms of behavior and lesson management, but the students with high needs make more progress as a result of the interaction.</p>
						<p>The length of time for specials such as physical education recently changed from 30 minutes to 45 minutes to allow for greater sharing of services across the district. Prior to this, we began training in the Literacy Collaborative, an evidence-based reading and writing initiative. We are moving from the traditional classroom model to a collaborative mode. State testing and the publishing of test scores have districts looking carefully at curriculum and staff use. No Child Left Behind (NCLB) calls for all students to learn and progress through the curriculum successfully, which has placed additional responsibility on classroom teachers and support staff. </p>
						<p>As the state and federal governments continue to raise the bar for all students, the academic instructional services (AIS) support team needed to become more focused, efficient and collaborative in order to make accurate assessments and plan effectively for students of concern. Teachers and support services staff now meet monthly to chart the progress of at-risk students.</p>
						<p>My schedule fluctuates throughout the year according to student needs and performance. E-mail allows me to stay in touch with teachers easily and in a timely manner. </p>
						<p>Documentation of the services provided is a huge and essential piece. I know people complain about the paperwork, but it is a key part of the intervention process. Creating a paper trail helps to hold yourself accountable for what you do and protects you when others ask, "What have you done to help this student?"</p>
						<p>There is no way we can work with every child who has a speech problem, nor do we need to. My solution to handling students with speech needs who are not on the schedule is to recheck them during the year and keep track of those who correct on their own and those who do not.</p>
						<p>During the late 1980s, I decided to figure out what percentage of students self-correct. The percentages ranged between 22 percent and 37 percent for grades 1-2. The percentages stayed consistently within that range for several years.</p>
						<p>However, after we implemented an evidence-based literacy program six years ago, along with teacher training, the self-correction rate went way up. Now the scores range from 40 percent to 60 percent. Classroom instruction provides high levels of differentiated instruction, specifically targeted skills that support reading, and a rich program of phonemic awareness. There is also much more sharing of information about students between classroom teachers and support staff.</p>
						<p>A common complaint by teachers is that children don't listen. Primary teachers especially are affected by this because their students can't read, so they must depend on the spoken word for instruction. In 2000 I implemented a kindergarten push-in program in the areas of listening and phonemic awareness. My goal was to work collaboratively in a hands-on way to support student achievement by teaching these skills. </p>
						<p>I address listening in the fall, and phonemic awareness occurs in the spring. I become a "center" in the classroom during workboard time, teaching small groups of students on a rotating basis for about 15 minutes per group.</p>
						<p>For listening I work with four kindergarten classes once a week, one hour per class, for six consecutive weeks. Goals include developing skills in speaker attentiveness, question and answer, and turn-taking. Visual icons are used to reinforce the skills, and teachers are encouraged to pair them with verbal instructions throughout the day. Extension lessons are provided for those students who are not learning the skill.</p>
						<p>The goals of my phonemic awareness push-in program include learning how to identify rhyming words, identify beginning and ending sounds, and do sound analysis and synthesis. The program does not present letters at all. Only pictures and the human voice are used.</p>
						<p>The two programs are well received by the kindergarten staff and helpful in developing the targeted skills. Additionally, when children who may be at-risk readers begin to surface in the spring, the program pulls some of them along enough so they can achieve mastery. Their response to the program gives teachers additional information to use when deciding which students may need additional reading support in first grade.</p>
						<p>It's exciting to be employed in public education. Rapid change and escalating expectations have produced growing pains for all concerned. The added demands have resulted in a much-needed scrutiny of what we teach, how we teach it, and what the outcomes are. It is far less teacher-centered and much more student-centered. That shift in focus is resulting in success for increasing numbers of children.</p>
						<p>As a speech-language pathologist in the schools, my goals are to help students achieve clear speech and to develop language skills that are structurally and functionally correct so they can blend seamlessly and effectively in social situations with their peers and participate confidently in the academic program. My goal is to work cooperatively and supportively with my educational colleagues.</p>
						<p>This is, joyfully, my 38th year in public education. My job has changed and expanded, and I have changed and expanded with it. I'm glad I didn't take early retirement.</p>
