						<p>Thank you for clicking on my website!</p>
						<p>As proprietor and sole therapist of Comprehensive Speech & Language Therapy Services, I am qualified to perform speech and language assessments as well as speech and language therapy.  Holding a New York State License in Speech/Language Pathology as well as ASHA (American Speech-Hearing-Language Association) certification, my credentials are supported by 40 years of full time work as a public school speech therapist with an emphasis in early childhood assessment and therapy.</p>
						<p>"Advance Magazine for Speech Pathologists & Audiologists" published my article reviewing my four decade careeer.  You can read it by clicking on 'publications' above.</p>
						<p>As part of my professional practice I developed a Response to Intervention (RTI) process specifically addressing student prioritizing, scheduling, listening skills and phonemic awareness skills.  An article outlining my RTI Speech Pyramid of Interventions was published in "Advance" mazagine and can be accessed by clicking on 'publications' above.</p> 
						<p>A third article reviewing RTI outcomes is forthcoming.</p>
						<p>In addition to working with clients in the Southern Tier of New York State, I offer a one day RTI seminar for public school speech/language therapists.  A description of this seminar can be accessed by clicking on 'seminar' above.</p>
						<p>In exciting news; my site has been updated to include information about my professional trip to china.
